## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Simply type in your task and press the "Add Task" button or hit Enter. The task will be added to the list.

2. **Priority Levels**: Every task can be assigned a priority level (High, Medium, or Low). Each priority level has its own section, and the tasks are sorted according to their priority level.

3. **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the 'x' button to the right of each task.

4. **Mark Tasks as Done**: Tasks can be marked as done by clicking the checkbox to the left of each task. Completed tasks will be crossed out.

5. **Local Storage**: The application uses local storage to save your tasks. This means your tasks will still be there the next time you open the app, even if you close your browser or turn off your computer.

## Usage

2. **Deleting a Task**: Click the 'x' button to the right of the task you want to delete.
